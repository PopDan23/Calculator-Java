# Calculator-Java
A new Java project with witch I make my first calculator using java programing
This is a new project in witch I update my first calculator in Java. The scope off this calculator is to use as much knowledge I have in this as I can.

Version 1.1 of Java Calculator : 
 - the program can use the basics operator as such : + , - , *, / ;
 - it does not have an interface yet, only in terminal;
 - only 2 numbers it can have, negative numbers work;

Version 1.2 of Java Calculator:
 - new we added operators as such : %, radical (r);
 - the code has more info about what we want;
 - resolved a bug where I could not generate radical for both numbers, only shows the radical for the first number (work in progress on this one);

Version 1.3 pf Java Calculator ( in progress): 
 - the option to repeat the calculus without re-run the test;
 - a more welcome interface;
 - more clean code after the stuff;
 -
